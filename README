Overview

The SlideKit class provides methods to build a single slide file out fragments
stored in a directory structure.  This slide file can then be converted into
html slides using a tools like s9 and s6.  Additionally, there are a few S9
helpers included that we use to help build the slides.

Usage:

We have included a sample Rakefile that can be adapted to your project needs.
The slide file building is defined by the Slidekit.build method:

s = SlideKit.new(project, outdir)
  s.build

Where project is the project directory and outdir is the output directory.

You should create your presentation in a self contained directory:

The configuration yaml file.

  <Project Name>/conf/<Project Name>.yaml

Example:

- Introduction to Puppet
- - intro
  - assigning_role
  - managing_drift
- Course Overview
- - overview
  - goals
  - executables

The project metadata file.

  <Project Name>/conf/<Project Name>.info

Example:

company: Puppet Labs
title: Puppet Training
footer: Copyright Puppet Labs 2010

The Slide src directory

  <Project Name>/src/slides
  (contains all of the presentation slides and directories).

Example:

|____Introduction_to_Puppet
| |____assigning_role.textile
| |____intro.textile
| |____managing_drift.textile
|____Course_Overview
| |____executables.textile
| |____goals.textile
